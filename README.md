Gross domestic product (GDP) is a measure of the market value of all the final goods and services produced in a period. GDP is an indicator of how well the economy is doing. A drop in GDP indicates the economy is producing less, similarly an increase in GDP suggests the economy is performing better. Here we have examined how changes in GDP impact the unemployment rate.
