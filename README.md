# Analyzing_USA_Economic_data_using_DataScience

### The Aim of the work is to proove the direct relationship between GDP and Unemployment.

Gross domestic product (GDP) is a measure of the market value of all the final goods and services produced in a period. GDP is an indicator of how well the economy is doing. A drop in GDP indicates the economy is producing less, similarly an increase in GDP suggests the economy is performing better. Here we have examined how changes in GDP impact the unemployment rate.


Extracting essential data from a dataset and displaying it is a necessary part of data science, this helps individuals take correct decisions based on the data. 

I have extracted essential economic indicators from the links given in references and displayed them in Dashboard in my Jupyter Notebook .
